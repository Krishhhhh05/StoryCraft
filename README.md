# StoryCraft: Creative Story Generation for Young Audiences
**Introduction**

This project combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with state of the art AI image generator to craft stories suitable for young children and audience.
StoryCraft is an innovative project that merges the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with cutting-edge AI image generation techniques to create captivating stories tailored for young children and audiences. By combining advanced natural language processing with state-of-the-art image synthesis, StoryCraft aims to revolutionize the storytelling experience, providing engaging narratives accompanied by vivid visualizations.

**Features**

- **Story Generation**: Utilizing powerful LLMs, StoryCraft generates compelling narratives suitable for young audiences. These stories are crafted with attention to age-appropriate content and language, fostering imagination and creativity in children.

- **Key Scene and Character Extraction**: StoryCraft extracts key scenes and character descriptions from generated stories, enhancing the storytelling experience by highlighting crucial moments and characters within the narrative.

- **Image Generation from Prompts**: Leveraging AI image generation prompts derived from the generated stories, StoryCraft produces vibrant and expressive images that bring the narrative to life. Extensive research and training have been conducted to ensure the quality and relevance of the generated images.

**How to Use**

1. **Story Generation**: Input desired story parameters such as theme, characters, and settings into the StoryCraft interface. The LLM engine will then generate a story tailored to the provided criteria. Using the finetuned Mistral model for the improved and appropriate accuracy.

2. **Key Scene and Character Extraction**: After generating a story, use the extraction module to identify key scenes and character descriptions. This module provides insights into pivotal moments and the personalities of characters within the narrative. Using methods and techiniques to simply the character description and maintaining uniformity in the characters. Expanding the description in a way it focuses on the setting and proves to be a better prompt description. 

3. **Image Generation**: Finally, input prompts derived from the generated story into the image generation module. StoryCraft will produce visually stunning images that complement the narrative, enhancing the storytelling experience for young audiences. Using finetuned models to generate images with cartoon / Disney-like characters for the suitable target audience.

**Examples**
